# Contributing to the Internship List

## Finding an Internship to Add

We ask that the internships that you add meet some requirements. Specifically, your internship must

- be in one of the following categories:
  - software/computer engineering
  - computer/data science
  - product management
  - quant
  - any other tech-related internships
- be located in the APAC (mostly Hong Kong or Singapore) or remote.
- not already exist in the internship list.

## Adding an Internship

Cool! You're ready to add an internship to the list. Follow these steps:

1. First create a new issue [here](https://github.com/ayazhankadessova/apac-internships-summer-2024/issues).
2. Select the **New Internship** issue template.
3. Fill in the information about your internship into the form, then hit submit.
   > Please make a new submission for each unique position, **even if they are for the same company**.
4. That's it! Once a member of our team has reviewed your submission, it will be automatically added to the correct `README`

## Editing an Internship

To edit an internship (changing name, setting as inactive, removing, etc.), follow these steps:

1. First copy the url of the internship you would like to edit.
   > This can be found by right-clicking on the `APPLY` button and selecting **copy link address**

3. Select the **Edit Internship** issue template.
4. Fill in the url to the **link** input.
   > This is how we ensure your edit affects the correct internship
5. Leave every other input blank except for whichever fields you would like to update or change about the internship.
6. If it is not obvious why you are making these edits, please specify why in the reason box at the bottom of the form.
7. Hit submit. A member of our team will review your revision and approve it shortly.

## Automatic README.md Updates

A script will automatically add new contributions to the appropriate README. The row will look something like this:

```md
